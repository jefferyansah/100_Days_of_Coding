### Summary of What I learned in Chapter 1

In Chapter 1 my key takes were :
* A shell is a program that allows you type isntrcutions to your computer
* Traceback is also known as stacktrace, tracestack or backtrace in other programming languages
*  Expressions are value combine with an operator
*  A variable is a box where you store values
*  A value that is passed into a funtion is called an argument


Answers to the Practice Questions
1. Which of the following are operators, and which are values? 

* Operators: `'*', '-', '/', '+'`
* Values : `'hello', '-88.8', '5'`

2. Which of the following is a variable, and which is a string?

* Variable : `spam`
* String : `'spam'`

3. Name three Data Types
* `Int`
* `String`
* `Float`

4.  What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
* `An expression is made up of a value and an operator`
* `All expressions evaluate to a single value`

5. This chapter introduced assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is 
the difference between an expression and a statement?
* `An expression evaluate to single value while a statement usually assigns a value to a variable`

6. What does the variable bacon contain after the following code runs?
bacon = 20
bacon + 1
* `Answer : 21`

7. What should the following two expressions evaluate to?
'spam' + 'spamspam' 
'spam' * 3
Answers
* `'spam' + 'spamspam'  = 'spamspamspam'`
* `'spam' * 3 = 'spamspamspam'`

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
* `Becuase python does not allow variable names to start with numbers `

9. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
Expression: 
```
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
```
This expression causes an error becuase you are attempting to concatenate an integer (99) with strings which is not permissible in python. To fix this, you have to cast the integer as string using 'str()' function. Thus the final correct systax will now look like this:
`'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.' `

Let's move on to chapter two
