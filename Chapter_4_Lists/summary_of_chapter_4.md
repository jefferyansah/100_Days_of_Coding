### Summary of Chapter 4: LISTS

* 
In Chapter 4 my key takes were :

* Values inside a list are called are called items.

* An index value fo a list  is the position of an item inside a list

* The values in a list of list can be accessed using multiple indexes.

* the `del` statement can be used to remove an item from a list. It can be also be used to delete variables (quite rare tho).


* The multiple assigment Trick is a great way to assign multiple variables with the values in a list using one line of code

* You can use the augmented assigment operator (for eg.  spam += 1 is thesame as spam= spam+1)
